OOP INTRODUCTION:

1. OOP - Object Oriented Programming:
Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language ie. Everything in java revolves around Objects and Classes.

2. Class: Basically a blueprint/Template out of which Objects can be created.
It is also defined as a group of properties/methods an object can have.

3. Object: Instance of a class (Why we need? class alone would be difficult to manipulate the properties of different data)

4. How to create an object:
Class_name obj_name=new Class_Name();
Eg.Human shapna=new Human(); [where "new" is a keyword that is used to create an object and allocate some memory dynamically on heap
                              shapna->reference variable(stored in stack) that points to the data in heap]
class Human{
   int name;
   int age;
   int eyes,ears,nose;                //properties || attributes
   boolean hasMobile(){ return true;} //method        [can be access like (System.out.println(shapna.hasMobile())]   or   [boolean hasMobile(boolean input){return input;}]
 }                                                    [System.out.println(shapna.hasMobile(true)]

5. DOT operator(.)- it is used to access the properties inside the object. Eg.shapna.name="shapna" or System.out.println(shapna.name)

6. Method can have datatype, access modifiers (public,private and protected-"the file inside the same package and subpackage can access it") ,name ,param.
