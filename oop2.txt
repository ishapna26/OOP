There are 4 main concepts in OOPS:   " Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance. "

import java.util.*;
class Amazon{
	String name;
	int amazonPayBalanace;
  public Amazon(can have params){
      //constructor that gets executed the minute the object is instantiated.
     //any number of constructores can be present in the class;
  }
}
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Amazon shapna=new Amazon();  ---->  //Amazon() is a special method that creates instance of this class. (it is called default constructor that creates object for you).
	}
}

1. constructor -> A constructor get implemented whenever the object for the class is instantiated. It has same name as that of class.
2. this keyword -> it used to "refer to a particular attribute in the class". Eg. this.amazonPayBalance

Example Program:

import java.util.*;
class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		amazonAccount shapna=new amazonAccount(200);//default constructor that creates instance/object of the class
		System.out.println(shapna.amazonPayBalance);
		
	}
}
class amazonAccount{
	String accountName;
	int amazonPayBalance;
	public amazonAccount(int amazonPayBalance) { //constructors parameter passing data type needs to be different !!!
		this.amazonPayBalance=amazonPayBalance;
		//this keyword refers to particular attribute in the class
	}
}
